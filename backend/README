                            1. Introduction
************************************************************************
    The backend lives on a hostmonster apache server. The server holds
raw patient audio data, a web API, and a MySQL database. The server
all of the processing of audio files and interactions with the database.

************************************************************************
                            2. Structure
************************************************************************
    The server can be accessed at http://skysip.org/p539. Here you will
find the root directory with 2 folders: "php" and "patient_data."

    The php folder contains the web API, with scripts for login and
registration, requesting cough data, and posting patient audio files.

    The patient_data folder holds a folder for each patient, and each
patient folder holds the audio files they have uploaded. If an audio
file exists in this folder, that means there is also a record in the
database containing the cough count found in this file. See the
Database section for more information.

                            3. Database
************************************************************************
    The database (called skysipor_p538) is a MySQL database that lives
on the server. It has a basic credentials table which is used for login
and registration. This table holds an ID, email, and hashed password for
each patient.

    The database also has a table called P0. This is the template of a
patient cough data table. It has 2 columns, DATE_TIME and COUGH_COUNT.
P0 is empty, it is simply used as a blueprint to construct cough tables
for actual patients. Each patient has a cough table, called P<ID>.
Each record in this table represents one hour of cough data. The
DATE_TIME field describes the time that the hour of data started, and
the COUGH_COUNT field describes the number of coughs in that hour.

                            4. Web API
************************************************************************
    The web API lives at http://skysip.org/p539/php. It has the
following files:

- db_config.php
    Defines database connection constants
- db_table_constants.php
    Defines database naming constants
- db_connect.php
    Class for connecting to the database
- login.php
    Responds to an HTTP GET request with a JSON object containing login
    success/failure. Takes an email and password as parameters.
- register.php
    Responds to a registration attempt with a JSON object containing
    success/failure and a message. If the registration is successful,
    the new patient is assigned an ID and a new table is created in the
    database to store their cough data.
- db_get_patient_cough_data.php
    Responds to an HTTP GET request with JSON data containing
    DATE_TIMEs and COUGH_COUNTs for one patient. The caller specifies
    patient's email and can also specify a range of dates/times for
    different chunks of cough data.
- post_wav.php
    Responds to an HTTP POST request with a JSON object containing
    success/failure and a message. This file allows the client to post
    a patient's cough recording to the server. When the server receives
    the file for patient with ID # at date_time YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS, it
    writes it to /p539/patient_data/audio/p#_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.wav.
    It then detects the number of coughs in the file and adds a record
    to the patient's cough table.
